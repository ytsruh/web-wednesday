              <h3>1. The oldest known pet cat existed 9,500 years ago</h3>
              <p>
                This interesting fact about cats is guaranteed to wow at your next dinner party. Did you know
                that originally it was thought that Egyptians domesticated the cat? But in 2004, French
                archaeologists discovered a 9,500 year old cat grave in Cyprus. This makes this the oldest
                known pet cat and it predates Egyptian art about cats by over 4,000 years!

              <p>
                You’ve heard of monkeys and dogs in space, but did you know that a cat braved the great
                unknown too? On October 18th 1963 Felicette, also known as ‘Astrocat’ was the first and only
                cat to go to space.

              <p>
                If you’ve watched your little kitty charging around the living room when they’re feeling
                lively you know that cats are pretty quick, but you won’t believe this fun cat fact. They can
                hit speeds of around 30mph which is so fast that they could beat Usain Bolt in a 200-metre
                dash!

              <p>
                An orange tabby cat called Stubbs was the mayor of Talkeetna, a small town in Alaska for 20
                years! He had several uncontested elections and although he didn’t hold any legislative power,
                he was loved by locals and tourists alike.

              <p>
                The richest cat in the world according to Guinness World Records is Blackie. When his
                millionaire owner passed away he refused to recognise his family in his will and instead gave
                his 7-million-pound fortune to Blackie! We can’t believe that interesting cat fact!
